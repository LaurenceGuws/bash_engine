Goals:
    Figure out how to properly: 
        - fold code blocks (I really like the toggle at the side of the number like vscode)
            1. manual (manually define folds)
            2. indent (more indent means higher fold level)
            3. marker (folds define by markers in the text)
            4. expr (specify an expression to define folds)
            5. syntax (folds defined by syntax highlighting)
            6. diff (folds for unchanged text)
        - change the active directory of the current explorer(up and down a dir)

    Add:
        - toggle for relative nums on/off
        - a easy mapping to switch between focusing buffer or explorer
        - external dependency list (yaml)
        - toggle wrap + sideways scroll with shift mouse scroll
        - proper diff integration

    Fix:
        - ctrl + a
            * its buggy with things like (does not full cover the file from start to finish)
                large files
                when used from the middle of the file

Large file UX.
    What has been implemented for this:
        - lua_line active line and char 
        - minimap
        - scroll bar

    What are things we can look at adding:
