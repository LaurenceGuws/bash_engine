We are porting my bash profile into a public repository.
We must proceed with great caution when making changes.
This profile has been actively developed by only me, for years now.
Pay close attention to convention and structures set up in the repo, and respect the architecture.
Our goal is to compete the tasks in the ToDo file in an unmached level of love and care for the greater good of bash.
